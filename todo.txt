X (map editor) allow multiple vertecies and easy point by point setup for dynamic objects (create and edit like regular shapes?)
X (map editor) re-sizable finish lines
\ (server/client) fix trap ability (currently not doing damage, funky styling and low density) (still isnt doing damage)
- (client) fix disconnect message (currently showing in the top-left of the screen)
X (client) re-style leaderboard
X (client) fix leaderboard stats not showing when spectating
X (server/client) add Max Boost upgrade
X (server/client) remove hammer
- (map editor) fix 'failed to save map' error when using 'save as' for a brand new map
- (map editor) fix setting preview images for existing maps
- (server) 'justCrashed = true' seems to be set after every 'handleCollision' method, let's just set justCrashed after a collision is finished
- (server/client) some map shape striped borders flicker/glitch at specific lengths (maybe trying to decide on stripe count)
\ (server) sort out the prod-key
- (client) clean chat when changing rooms
- (client) start line can have the same stutter/glitch effect
- (server/client) make the spawn point anywhere on the start line with some pixel padding to keep cars on the inside of borders
X (client) fix the favicon, it needs that transparent background and could look cleaner
\ (client) fix rendering of shapes that have concave vertecies, currently only the shape of the outer-most verticies are rendered, UPDATE: HTML canvas can't do this unless every vertex array is split into 'shape' and 'shape incuts', putting this on hold.
- (client) can we get stripe rendering on shape edges to alternate around the entire shape? stripes currently alternate for each side, which leaves many double colors on anything with alot of sides/verticies
X (server/client) add kill 'tagging'. if a car causes damage to another car and they crash within a small window afterwards (2 seconds?), it is treated as a kill via the damager
X (server/client) kills via ability objects credit the ability object owner for the kill
X (server/client) XP for kills
- (client) real-time xp animations?
- (client) 'Can't find player, returning to menu' error after crashing. Worringly the logic could be relying on this break to get back to spectating
- (server) there's something going on with the auth. session names can't be found until a player has played a lap and then crashed? they should be able to be seen after auth
- (client) title redesign? could be done in canvas so we can have nice rounded edges in a different colour than white? put title builder in a helper function so we can build it whenever, wherever (loading screens, auth, title, etc.)
X (client) leaderboard stats for KDR and laps can sometimes be the wrong style - white?
- (client) leaderboard best time doesn't seem to be working, it's not even sent in the state it looks like.
X (client) show level of player in leaderboard
X (client) remove 'rank' column on the leaderboard
- (client) lay area affects under shape borders (striped lines) but above the filled shape.
- (client) change `alert()` errors for something more sensible (vuetify-style rules/validation errors?)
- (map editor) option to turn off collisions with walls on dynamic objects, it would allow spinners to clip through the side
- (map editor / client / server) Change the way shapes work completely. We rely on hollow shapes for collisions when we could just be using full shapes with holes in the center? It gives us so much more control over border thickness and level design.
- (client/server) update debugger to only show for isDev players
- (client/server) gamemodes? deathmatch, teams
- (client/server) round modifiers? peaceful (no collide), double upgrade points, randomizer abilities/upgrades (ability objects could use car colour, then could be suitible for all cars!)
- (client/server) change the colour of the default shape borders, the red is a bit strong, go lighter
- (map editor) allow shape layer editing for proper overlapping of shapes
- (client/server) leaderboard for registered accounts / shows top levels and their career stats (will require tracking of kills/deaths/wins in official servers) would be really cool to track their main cartype too
- (map editor) force users to include at least one checkpoint (maybe not if we introduce gamemodes??)
- (map editor) shapes can be have collisions enabled/disabled on shape and border
- (map editor) don't allow editing of author name when saving
- (map editor) get rid of the area effect emojis
X (map editor) fix 'back' button and give it styling
- (server/map editor) we have server.js code preventing users from editing other users maps. Either we keep this or introduce a 'copy' feature where users can copy other users creations
- (client/server) we still have a weird glitch where when the angle is 0 or 360 on the players car and ticks over to either 360 or 0, the car will do a fast spin, which can be annoying
- (client/server) custom border widths are not rendering correctly
X (client/server) trap size / damage upgrades
- (client/server) dash power upgrades
- (client) changelog window
X (client) disconnected screen doesn't hide room name/map header and changelog/leaderboard buttons
- (client) the driftz.io title seems to be messing with player movement. do we have the wrong css props on it? UPDATE: not the ui elements, it's biased to turn to each corner when cursor is further away?? is it stupid???
- (client/server) overheal
- (client/server) increase body.slop prop on cannonballs to help with collision response for very fast shots
- (server) only pick OFFICIAL maps for official rooms, shapeconfigtest is being pulled through somehow?
X (client) feature where if the cursor is far enough away from the spectator menu ui, it becomes transparent so you can just watch the match unfold
