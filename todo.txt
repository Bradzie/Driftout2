X (map editor) allow multiple vertecies and easy point by point setup for dynamic objects (create and edit like regular shapes?)
X (map editor) re-sizable finish lines
X (server/client) fix trap ability (currently not doing damage, funky styling and low density)
- (client) fix disconnect message (currently showing in the top-left of the screen)
X (client) re-style leaderboard
X (client) fix leaderboard stats not showing when spectating
- (server/client) add Max Boost upgrade
X (server/client) remove hammer
- (map editor) fix 'failed to save map' error when using 'save as' for a brand new map
- (map editor) fix setting preview images for existing maps
- (server) 'justCrashed = true' seems to be set after every 'handleCollision' method, let's just set justCrashed after a collision is finished
- (server/client) some map shape striped borders flicker/glitch at specific lengths (maybe trying to decide on stripe count)
- (server) sort out the prod-key
- (client) clean chat when changing rooms
- (client) start line can have the same stutter/glitch effect
- (server/client) make the spawn point anywhere on the start line with some pixel padding to keep cars on the inside of borders
X (client) fix the favicon, it needs that transparent background and could look cleaner
\ (client) fix rendering of shapes that have concave vertecies, currently only the shape of the outer-most verticies are rendered, UPDATE: HTML canvas can't do this unless every vertex array is split into 'shape' and 'shape incuts', putting this on hold.
- (client) can we get stripe rendering on shape edges to alternate around the entire shape? stripes currently alternate for each side, which leaves many double colors on anything with alot of sides/verticies
X (server/client) add kill 'tagging'. if a car causes damage to another car and they crash within a small window afterwards (2 seconds?), it is treated as a kill via the damager
- (server/client) kills via ability objects credit the ability object owner for the kill
- (server/client) XP for kills
- (client) real-time xp animations?
- (client) 'Can't find player, returning to menu' error after crashing. Worringly the logic could be relying on this break to get back to spectating
- (server) there's something going on with the auth. session names can't be found until a player has played a lap and then crashed? they should be able to be seen after auth
- (client) title redesign? could be done in canvas so we can have nice rounded edges in a different colour than white? put title builder in a helper function so we can build it whenever, wherever (loading screens, auth, title, etc.)
X (client) leaderboard stats for KDR and laps can sometimes be the wrong style - white?
- (client) leaderboard best time doesn't seem to be working, it's not even sent in the state it looks like.
X (client) show level of player in leaderboard
- (client) remove 'rank' column on the leaderboard
- (client) lay area affects under shape borders (striped lines) but above the filled shape.
